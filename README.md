# Self-Parking-Simulation
For the final project of CEE/MAE M20, this script simulates a self-parking car that navigates from the left edge to the closest parking spot in a lot of 20 rows (10 on top and 10 on bottom). The parked cars that populate the lot are filled in pseudorandomly, ranging from 1 to 19 cars. It further generates an animation at 30 frames per second for 10 seconds, where the first frame of the video displays the car's initial position (in UCLA blue) and final destination (in red) along with its travel path. The travel path always consists of three segments: a horizontal segment, quarter-circle rotation, and vertical path to the lot after completing its rotation.
